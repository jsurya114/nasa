# Journal

The team's record of every change to code, the database, configuration, dependencies and repository settings. Read it from the top before you start any task. Rules for writing entries are in [ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md §8](ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md#8-the-journal).

- Newest entry first. Never edit or delete an old entry. Add a correcting entry instead.
- Public repository: no secrets, real data or exploit steps.

### J-001 — Add engineering standard and journal

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 31 October 2026 |
| Author | Jayasoorya Suryadas, with Claude Code |
| Branch / PR | `docs/engineering-standard` / pull request into `develop` |
| Type / scope | `docs(docs)` |
| Files touched | `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` (new), `docs/JOURNAL.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md` (two added lines) |
| Reserved files touched | None |

**What and why.** Adds the engineering standard that every change must follow, and this journal. The standard sets the working rules: work on `develop`, `main` stays untouched until the owner gives the exact instruction, read the journal before a task, record a journal entry after one. The journal lets two people and two AI assistants see each other's changes and avoid conflicts. `CLAUDE.md` now points assistants to both files.

**Database.** None.

**Config and dependencies.** None.

**Money impact.** None.

**Tested.** Documentation only. Checked that links between the files resolve and that the commit message passes the repository hook. No application code was run.

**Risks and follow-ups.** None. Update the ownership table above when Jasil's Excel work finishes.
